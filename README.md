A webpage project to practice JS, HTML, and CSS skills - made by Kijoon Yun, guided by 내일배움캠프 coding bootcamp.

The webpage fetch data from TMDB API to bring in the data of top 20 highest-rating movies of all time,
then displays each movie data in cards - including the movie title, description, ratings, and posters - all of which is brought from the TMDB server database.

When the user clicks each movie card, the alert messagebox pops up which shows the TMBD ID of the clicked movie.

On the top of the webpage a search input form is located - in which the user can type in the title of the movie.
Once the '검색' button is clicked, only the movies with the title that includes the input words will be shown, hiding all the other movies.
